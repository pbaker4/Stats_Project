Car Fueling Data
Starting odometer reading: 81237
Initial measurements acquired:

| Trial | Miles to E Start | Miles to E End | Odometer Reading | Gas Used (Gallons) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 366 | 8 | 81567 | 11.972 |  
| 2 | 362 | 34 | 81901 | 11.428 |
| 3 | 352 | - | - | - |
| 4 | - | - | - | - |

To test the hypothesis need to acquire from this the predicted distance travelled and the distance travelled according to the odometer

| Trial | MTE distance | Odometer distance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 366-8=358 | 81567-81237=330 |
| 2 | 362-34=328 | 81901-81567=334 |
| 3 | - | - |
